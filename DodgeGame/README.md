# Dodge Game

- Created by Tom Scott for IT4425
- Purpose: To create my first game using SpriteKit, where the player drags a sprite along the screen to dodge moving enemies. Multiple levels with increasing difficulty will be implemented. 
- Rules
- The player will have three lives per level. Reaching the green goal at the top will advance the level. Hitting an enemy sprite will lose one life, and if the player loses all lives, the game will end. If the player completes all levels, they win the game.
